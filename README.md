  <h2 align="center"> About </h2>  
  
  Long ago, When the World was full of mystery. A new form of collection was born, The Cabinet of Curiosities. This collection would take the form of a secret chamber, or perhaps as a piece of furnature. In these private collecions one my find forbidden books, strange paintings, or creatures of natural or unatural history. A dragon's tooth, a giants toe, a yeti's fur, each of these create a story. Beyond that a entry in to a mythical world.

I used the words Zombie and Goblin as the primary search in the creation of this project. 
  
The Monster Mash project is hopefully going to be apart of a greater project called Cabinet de Curio.
  
There are 2 well known 5e API's and I joined the Discord of the one diffrent from the API I was using and asked a question about using it. Embarrassing!
  
I regularly play D&D and reenact my adventures to my wife after the game. She is very polite.
